Adding Users to your Skribble Business Account
==============================================

There are two ways to add users to your Skribble Business Account:

- By Domain (whitelisting)
- e-mail invite

The simplest way to add multiple users to your Business Account is by registering your company domain (@example.org). Once this is complete, any user who creates a new Skribble account using your company domain will automatically be a part of your Business Account.

**Note:** Any users at your company who created a Skribble account *before* your domain was registered with your Business Account will not be added automatically to your account. You will need to add those users by e-mail invite, described below.

When users follow the invitation to create a Skribble account, they are automatically added to your business account.
