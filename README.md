Documentation for the my.skribble.com business accounts UI


## Work on the content

You need to install Sphinx 3.x on your local system to work on the documentation.
Check out [Sphinx's install instructions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).
We recommend you use `conda` on all platforms.

Content is in files ending with `.rst`. A [primer on rST](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) is useful for getting the syntax right.

To create the HTML run `make html` in a terminal. This will tell you where
it created the rendered output (probably `_build/html/index.html`). Open it
in your browser to see your work.
